## An app aimed for restaurant owners to manage their customers with minimum contact, when customer’s seated at a restaurant table.

### Features will include:
- The app shows a menu as a list.
- Menu list is fetched from an API and saved in the app.
- Users can choose menu items and add them to their order.
- Upon placing an order, users can select or add a tip.
- Upon checkout, total amount will be calculated.
- Users can write a review of the menu item and add a photo of the dish.

## To-do: Week 1
- Build the first two screens of the app: Home & Onboarding Screen
- Home Screen: The screen needs to have a “Welcome, [userName].” text as a header.
- Home Screen: On the top right of the screen, next to the header, add a button as an SF Symbol. When tapped, present a second screen of your app, called Onboarding screen. (Choose an SF Symbol that best fits the use case).
- Onboarding: The screen needs to have a text with the app name at the top and a few description lines telling the user what the app is about. Write a few features the app will have.
